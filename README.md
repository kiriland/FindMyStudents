## Deployment

To package and deploy the application to AWS Lambda Web Functions, run the following commands:

1. **Build and prepare the standalone package:**
   ```bash
   npm run prep:standalone
   ```
2. Deploy to AWS Lambda Web Functions:
   ```bash
   aws lambda-web deploy --name FindMyStudents --code ./.next/standalone --create
   ```

## Project structure

The application is a modular monolith: one deployable Next.js application with
business concerns grouped into feature modules.
